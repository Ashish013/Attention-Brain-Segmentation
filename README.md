# Effect of Attention in Deep Neural Nets for Brain Tumour Segmentation

With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the codes required to produce the results in the manuscript: 

> P. R. Medi<sup>\*</sup>, A. Marisetty<sup>\*</sup>, D. R. Neog, and S. Dev, Effect of Attention in Deep Neural Nets for Brain Tumour Segmentation, *under review*, 2022. (<sup>\*</sup> equal contribution)

Please cite the above paper if you intend to use whole/part of the code. This code is only for academic and research purposes.


## Code Organization
All codes are written in `python`. 

### Code 
The script to reproduce all the figures, tables in the paper are as follows:
+ `Single-Stage-Networks.ipynb`: Performs TO-DO.
+ `Traditional-ML-methods.ipynb`: Performs TO-DO.

### Dataset 
We also share the dataset used in our paper, and can be found via TO-DO.
